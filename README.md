# en-de-codejm
A basic encoder and decoder combination for the purpose of practicing with PHP.

Stage 1 (Encoder): 

The user enters a message. The message is converted to ASCII and the ASCII value is increased by a set number.

The new array of ASCII values is converted to an array of characters, and then to a string.

The "encoded" message is printed for the user.
